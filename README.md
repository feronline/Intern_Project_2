# 🚗 Freespace Segmentation with FCNN

This project was developed as part of an internship focused on freespace segmentation for autonomous vehicles. The goal is to identify drivable areas in images using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN).


## 🧠 Model

- Architecture: Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)
- Framework: PyTorch
- Output: Binary segmentation masks (Freespace / Not Freespace)

## 🛠️ Pipeline

1. **Annotation → Mask Conversion** using OpenCV
2. **Tensorization** of images and masks
3. **Model Training** with loss tracking and validation
4. **Prediction** on test images
5. **Visualization** of results

## 📈 Training Performance

- 469 annotated image-mask pairs
- Trained for 20 epochs
- Achieved validation loss: **~0.17**

## 👨‍💻 Intern Summary
This project was conducted over 20 days and covered:

- JSON annotation parsing
